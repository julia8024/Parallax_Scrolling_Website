        <h2>Parallax Scroll Effents</h2>
        <p>Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website background moves at a slower 
            pace than the foreground. This results in a 3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, 
            adding a sense of depth and creating a more immersive browsing experience. 
            Parallax is based on optical illusion. 
            Since the human eye perceives objects that are close to us as larger than things farther away, 
            we perceive distant objects as if they were moving more slowly. 
            The illusion has been long adopted into parallax across different mediums, fostering a realistic effect. 
            Its first use was in traditional animation, dating back to as early as Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, 
            and in video games such as Super Mario. 
            With advancements in CSS and HTML, parallax effects later evolved into the world of web design as we know it today. 
            Here are nine outstanding parallax scrolling examples built with Wix, handpicked for your web design inspiration:)<br><br></p>
        <h4>Parallax scrolling examples</h4><br><br>
        <h6>01. Mild Design</h6><br>
        <p>Emilie De Grosbois, a Montreal-based visual artist and the founder of Mild Design, can show us a thing or two about how to make a portfolio. 
            Her own portfolio website strikes visitors with an impressive welcome: a series of intricate fullscreen images displayed in a long scroll. 
            These are some of the best website images we've seen. 
            By use of parallax, the transition from one image to the next becomes not only smoother, but it also adds a sense of depth, 
            as if the images gently glide on top of each other.<br><br></p>
        <h6>02. Nolan Omura</h6><br>
        <p>Nolan Omura is a Hawaii-based photographer and videographer specializing in underwater photography. His ingenious take on the parallax scrolling effect 
            adds depth and motion to his already captivating homepage design. 
            By dividing the page into full-width strips, site visitors are met with exhilarating shots of aquatic life each time they scroll down further. 
            The strips float gently above one another, using a mix of both parallax and reveal scrolling effects.  
            Giving the photographs even more movement are minute animations. While these are barely discernible, the website animations 
            - combined with the use of parallax and video - make this page fully come to life.<br><br></p>
        <h6>03. Chris Covert</h6>
        <p>Aerospace engineer Chris Covert’s bold resume website is just as professional as it is innovative. 
            The site’s design and interactivity manage to inject much of Chris’ personality into what could have otherwise been 
            a dry list of skills, experience, and education history. 
            Chris places shots of his printed CV and business card in the center of the screen. Using the reveal scroll effect, 
            the website background images swiftly changes behind them as the visuals stay put, achieving a surprising result. 
            Paying much attention down to the smallest of details, the website provides a remarkable answer to the question of how
             to write a resume. It also includes a downloadable PDF document of the CV for potential employers to print out.<br><br></p>
        <h6>04. Ivy Chen</h6>
        <p>Designer and illustrator Ivy Chen’s use of parallax makes for a unique portfolio website, in which her works gradually reveal 
            themselves as if by scrolling magic. Ivy’s use of the parallax scrolling effect is not only mesmerizing, but also amplifies 
            and explains the page’s content. As a multidisciplinary designer, she operates at the intersection of illustration and graphic design. 
            The two fields are integrated seamlessly, with her fashion illustrations slowly transforming into real life garments as we scroll.<br><br></p>
        <h6>05. Industrial Jewellery</h6>
        <p>Jewelry designer Hila Rawet Karni’s website employs parallax scrolling to create an interesting, multifaceted browsing experience. 
            By layering images and text on top of one another and having them move at different speeds, the page seems to be constantly changing and 
            forming new compositions as we scroll. The layered look also helps this small business website keep up with the latest web design trends. 
            Notice, for example, how the middle photo of a sitting woman stays in place as other elements drift alongside it. 
            That photo eventually rolls out of the screen too, making room for other sections of this website and achieving a dynamic feel.<br><br></p>
